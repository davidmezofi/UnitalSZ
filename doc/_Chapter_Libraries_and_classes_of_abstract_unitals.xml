  <Func Arg="q" Name="HermitianAbstractUnital" />
 <Returns>The classical unital object, which is the abstract unital of order <A>q</A> isomorphic to the Hermitian curve in the classical projective plane.
</Returns>
 <Description>
The Hermitian curve has the following canonical equation: <M>X_0^{q + 1} +
X_1^{q + 1} + X_2^{q + 1} = 0</M>. The function computes the blocks of the
unital with the help of <C>PGU(3,<A>q</A>)</C> and calls
<C>AbstractUnitalByDesignBlocks</C>. The <C>Name</C> of the unital is set as
<C>HermitianAbstractUnital(<A>q</A>)</C>.

  <Func Arg="nr, q, filename" Name="AU_ReadLibraryDataFromFiles" />
 <Returns>The list of boolean incidence matrices of size <M>(q^3 + 1) \times q^2(q^2 - q + 1)</M> read from <A>filename</A>.
</Returns>
 <Description>
The file <A>filename</A> must be gzipped and must contain <A>nr</A>
matrices of dimension mentioned above. The matrices must be 0-1 matrices
without any whitespace between the entries in one row and there must not be
any empty lines between matrices.

  <Func Arg="n" Name="BBTAbstractUnital" />
 <Returns>The <A>n</A>th (abstract) unital of order 3 of the unitals by Betten, Betten and Tonchev.
</Returns>
 <Description>
In the paper Unitals and codes by Anton Betten, Dieter Betten and Vladimir
D. Tonchev (Discrete Mathematics 267, 2003, 23-33.) 909 unitals of order 3
were constructed. The incidence matrices of these unitals are shipped with
the package.

 <Description>
In the paper The Kramer-Mesner method with tactical decompositions: some
new unitals on 65 points by Vedran Krčadinac, Anamari Nakić and Mario Osvin
Pavčević (Journal of Combinatorial Designs 19, 2011, 290-303.) 1777 unitals
of order 4 were constructed. The incidence matrices of these unitals are
shipped with the package.

In the paper Steiner 2-designs S(2, 4, 28) with nontrivial automorphisms by
Vedran Krčadinac (Glasnik Matematički, Vol. 37 (57), 2002, 259-268.) 4466
unitals of order 3 were constructed. This library contains all the unitals
of order 3 with nontrivial automorphism group. The incidence matrices of
these unitals are shipped with the package.
