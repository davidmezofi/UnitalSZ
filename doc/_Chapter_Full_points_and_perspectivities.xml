  <Oper Arg="u, b1, b2" Name="FullPointsOfUnitalsBlocks" Label="for IsAbstractUnitalDesign, IsPosInt, IsPosInt"/>
 <Returns>The list full point of <A>u</A> w.r.t. the blocks <A>b1,b2</A>. The arguments <A>b1,b2</A> are either blocks of the unital <A>u</A>, or indices of blocks in <C>BlocksOfUnital( u )</C>.
</Returns>
 <Description>
The point <M>P</M> is a <E>full point</E> of the unital <M>U</M> w.r.t. the blocks
<M>b_1,b_2</M> if <M>P</M> is not contained in <M>b_1</M> or <M>b_2</M>, and,
the projection with center <M>P</M> from <M>b_1</M> to <M>b_2</M> is a
well-defined bijection.

<ManSection>
  <Attr Arg="u" Name="FullPointsOfUnitalRepresentatives" Label="for IsAbstractUnitalDesign"/>
 <Returns>A list of records <C>r</C> containing the fields <C>r.block1, r.block2, r.fullpts</C>, where <C>r.fullpts</C> is the set of full point of <A>u</A> w.r.t. the blocks <C>r.block1, r.block2</C>. The returned list contains all possible full points of <A>u</A> up to the automorphism group of <A>u</A>. That is, if <M>P</M> is a full point w.r.t. the blocks <M>b_1,b_2</M>, then there is an automorphism <M>\alpha</M> of <M>U</M> such that <M>P^\alpha, b_1^\alpha, b_2^\alpha</M> are in the list.

<ManSection>
  <Oper Arg="u, b1, b2[, fullpts]" Name="PerspectivityGroupOfUnitalsBlocks" Label="for IsAbstractUnitalDesign, IsList, IsList, IsList"/>
 <Returns>The group generated by perspectivies from block <A>b1</A> to block <A>b2</A> of the unital <A>u</A>. Notice that the returned group consists of permutations of <C>[1..Order(u)+1]</C>. A list of full points can be given as 4th argument. It is not checked if the elements of <A>fullpts</A> are full points.
</Returns>
 <Description>
Perspectivities between blocks <M>b_1, b_2</M> of an abstract unital <M>U</M>
are projections from <M>b_1</M> to <M>b_2</M> from a center <M>P</M>. In order the
perspectivity be well-defined, <M>P</M> must be a full point w.r.t. <M>b_1, b_2</M>.
